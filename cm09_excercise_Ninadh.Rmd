## Reading and Writing Data: Exercises
Make a tibble of letters, their order in the alphabet, and then a pasting of the two columns
together.
```{r}
```
Make a tibble of three names and commute times.
```{r}
```
Write the `iris` data frame as a `csv`.
```{r}
```
Write the `iris` data frame to a file delimited by a dollar sign.
```{r}
```
Read the dollar-delimited `iris` data to a tibble.
```{r}
```
Read these three LOTR csv's, saving them to `lotr1`, `lotr2`, and `lotr3`:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Two_Towers.csv
- https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv
```{r}
```
## `gather()`
(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [gather tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotrtidy/
blob/master/02-gather.md))
This function is useful for making untidy data tidy (so that computers can more easily crunch
the numbers).
1. Combine the three LOTR untidy tables (`lotr1`, `lotr2`, `lotr3`) to a single untidy table by
stacking them.

```{r}
```
2. Convert to tidy. Also try this by specifying columns as a range, and with the `contains()`
function.
```{r}
```
3. Try again (bind and tidy the three untidy data frames), but without knowing how many tables
there are originally.
- The additional work here does not require any additional tools from the tidyverse, but
instead uses a `do.call` from base R -- a useful tool in data analysis when the number of
"items" is variable/unknown, or quite large.
```{r}
```
## `spread()`
(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [spread tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotrtidy/
blob/master/03-spread.md))
This function is useful for making tidy data untidy (to be more pleasing to the eye).
Read in the tidy LOTR data (despite having just made it):
```{r}
lotr_tidy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotrtidy/
master/data/lotr_tidy.csv")
```
Get word counts across "Race". Then try "Gender".
```{r}
```
Now try combining race and gender. Use `unite()` from `tidyr` instead of `paste()`.
```{r}
```
## Other `tidyr` goodies
Check out the Examples in the documentation to explore the following.
`expand` vs `complete` (trim vs keep everything). Together with `nesting`. Check out the
Examples in the `expand` documentation.
```{r}
```
`separate_rows`: useful when you have a variable number of entries in a "cell".
```{r}
```
`unite` and `separate`.
```{r}

```{r}
```
`uncount` (as the opposite of `dplyr::count()`)
```{r}
```
`drop_na` and `replace_na`
```{r}
```
`fill`
```{r}
```
`full_seq`
```{r}
```
## Time remaining?
Time permitting, do [this exercise](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-
gather.md#exercises) to practice tidying data.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
