## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
my_commute = 30
```

```{r}
preamble= "my commute time, in minutes"
```

```{r}
commute = c(my_commute, 30, 15, 40)
(n= length(commute))
```
```{r}
(mu = sum(commute / n))
(diff = commute - mu)
(variance = sum (diff^2)/ (n-1))
(var (commute))
```


```{r}
typeof(preamble)
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
